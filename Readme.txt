Hello!

This project is an iOS app I was working on awhile back. The goal of this app was to create a simple tick tac toe game,
but put a twist on the original game by adding new functionality.

It also has a fully functioning self coded AI that you can play against.

I imported this repository from my old system, so some of the code might need formatted.

Please feel free to download and/or make improvements to the game, as long as you give me credit. 
When I stopped working on it, I was working on adding different gameplay variations.

Thanks,

Brayden
