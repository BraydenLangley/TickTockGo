Hello!

This project is an iOS app that I was working on awhile back. The goal of this app was to create a simple tick-tac-toe game
but put a twist on the original game by adding new functionality.

It also has a fully-functioning and self-coded AI that you can play against.

I imported this repository from my old system so some of the code might need formatted, FYI.

Please feel free to download and/or make improvements to the game, as long as you give me credit for my code. 
When I stopped working on it, I was in the processes of adding different gameplay variations.

Thanks,

Brayden
